1. Product Vision & Core Principles
1.1. Product Vision
To be the definitive digital ecosystem where verified medical aesthetics professionals can build their brand, monetize their expertise, and cultivate a professional community, while providing practitioners worldwide with trusted, high-caliber education and career development opportunities.

1.2. Core Principles
Trust & Verification: The platform's foundation is the authenticity of its creators. Every expert is manually verified to ensure a safe, professional, and credible environment. This principle dictates a zero-tolerance policy on unverified claims and a commitment to a rigorous onboarding process.

Creator Empowerment: Provide a comprehensive, intuitive, all-in-one toolkit that removes technical barriers. The user experience for creators should feel seamless, powerful, and supportive, allowing them to focus on creating high-value content.

Structured Learning: Go beyond simple video hosting. Offer a sophisticated LMS that facilitates structured learning, skill validation, and professional accreditation. The consumer experience should be geared towards tangible professional growth.

Community & Collaboration: Foster a vibrant professional network where learning is a collaborative experience. Features should encourage interaction, discussion, and networking among peers and with experts.
